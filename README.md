# Data Scientist at Haier Europe since Mar 2025

# Side Project, Stock Price Prediction: 

Creating a full‑stack stock‑forecasting web app that pulls monthly price series from yfinance, enriches them with statistical technical indicators, and serves 3‑month forecasts from AutoGluon deep‑learning models via Python.
The JavaScript front‑end renders interactive prices by retrieving data via the FAST API and indicator graphs, while an embedded LangChain‑powered chatbot delivers conversational equity insights. 
backend: Python, technical indicators, stocks data, JSON, PostgreSQL
frontend: html, css, javascript, fastapi
AI: time series deep learning, autogluon, LLM, langchain, chatbot, extraction,  semantic search, AI agent
Roadmap includes semantic search on news and agent‑driven RAG analytics for deeper market intelligence.

The [University of Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bonn) is one of the largest research-based universities in the world. The THE ranking is [89](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2023/world-ranking) and the QS ranking is [201](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2023) in the world in 2023.

Being the best university in Germany in the field of mathematics, Uni of Bonn has also adjusted its computer science department to have a solid mathematical foundation. For this reason, many courses are built on combining heavy mathematical theory and practical coding skills, and the language of instruction is 100% English.

# Java Software Engineer for 1 year

<img src="https://github.com/cuneyterem8/uni_bonn_background/blob/main/diplomas/TEB_LOGO.png" width="40%" height="30%">

I worked in the campaign software unit within the CRM software of TEB bank for almost 1 year. [Turkish Economy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrk_Ekonomi_Bankas%C4%B1) is one of the top 10 largest and oldest banks in Turkey, headquartered in Istanbul.

During this period, I worked on tasks such as developing in-bank software with Java language and evam tool (in-bank software), updating existing codes, and designing applications for the needs of business units.
